## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a software engineer exploring the architecture and development of micro-frontends using module federation. This space serves as a collection of projects, experiments, and patterns that reflect my work and learning in building scalable, modular web applications.

My focus is on breaking down large frontend codebases into independently deployable pieces that can be developed, tested, and maintained in isolationâ€”while still delivering a seamless experience to end users. With the help of Webpack Module Federation, Iâ€™ve been experimenting with strategies to dynamically load and share code across different applications without tight coupling.

This repository includes examples of shared component libraries, independently deployed micro-apps, shell containers, and integration techniques across different teams or domains. I also explore common challenges like shared state management, routing across remotes, version compatibility, and performance optimization in distributed frontends.

I believe micro-frontends are more than just a technical solutionâ€”they're an architectural approach to solving scaling issues in modern frontend development. Through these projects, I aim to apply best practices in code splitting, CI/CD, team collaboration, and long-term maintainability.

Whether you're just starting to explore module federation or already building large-scale frontend systems, feel free to browse the code, check out the architecture patterns, or contribute to the discussion. I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and learning from others in the community.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope this repository offers some helpful insights, inspiration, or even a starting point for your own micro-frontend journey.
